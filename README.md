# Give it a shot
A tool built for simplifying the process of compiling and generating needed files for byacc/j and jflex

## Instructions
- Place the .l and .y files in the same folder of this tool (give-it-a-shot.bat). 
- Both files need to have the same name except the extension (Ex: foo.l & foo.y)
- Then just run give-it-a-shot <filename> (Ex: give-it-a-shoot foo). It will automatically do the process for you.
